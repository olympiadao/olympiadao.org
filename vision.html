        Beyond the Upgrade
      </div>
      <h2>Where Ethereum Classic Is Headed</h2>
      <p>
        Olympia lays the foundation for Ethereum Classic to operate as a secure, neutral,
        self-funding Proof-of-Work smart contract platform—not just for the next cycle, but for the
        next decade and beyond. This page outlines the long-term vision that informs Olympia’s
        design and explains how these upgrades support ETC’s future trajectory.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        The vision centers around sustainability, decentralization, and the belief that
        immutability and open participation create the most durable smart contract base layer in
        the world.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"></i> Guiding Principles</h3>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic’s long-term vision remains anchored to the same philosophical principles
        that have defined the chain since 2016. Olympia amplifies—not replaces—these commitments.
      </p>

          <h4>Immutability as a Social Contract</h4>
          <p>
            ETC’s greatest strength is the predictability and permanence of its ledger. Olympia
            preserves this by avoiding inflation, avoiding social rule changes, and keeping
            governance external to the protocol layer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Proof-of-Work as a Security Anchor</h4>
          <p>
            ETC remains committed to PoW as a mechanism for censorship resistance and open access.
            Olympia strengthens PoW by adding more predictable long-term incentives (via optional
            smoothing) and sustainable development funding.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Decentralization Through Modularity</h4>
          <p>
            The DAO is modular, the treasury is immutable, and BASEFEE redirection is rules-based.
            No single entity has structural control, and governance modules can evolve without
            rewriting history.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Neutrality &amp; Openness</h4>
          <p>
            Olympia avoids enshrining voter identity, token economics, or political preferences
            directly in the protocol. This keeps ETC open to builders, researchers, businesses,
            miners, and communities worldwide.
          </p>

    <section id="future">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-seedling"></i> The Future Enabled by Olympia</h3>
      <p>
        With a sustainable treasury and a standardized governance process, ETC can support a much
        broader ecosystem than was previously possible. Olympia is the beginning of a multi-year
        expansion of capabilities, talent, and infrastructure.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>A Multi-Client, Multi-Team Development Model</h4>
          <p>
            ETC no longer relies on a single organization or donor. Multiple independent client
            teams—Core-Geth, Besu-ETC, Fukuii, and future implementations—can be funded sustainably,
            improving security and reducing systemic fragility.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Reliable Infrastructure for Builders</h4>
          <p>
            Long-term funding enables better RPC networks, explorers, testnets, indexers, and
            tooling. Builders get a stable foundation that attracts applications, liquidity, and
            new users.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Professionalized Ecosystem Growth</h4>
          <p>
            Hackathons, grants, audits, documentation initiatives, education programs, and community
            outreach become predictable and scalable instead of ad-hoc.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>DAO-Native Governance Culture</h4>
          <p>
            Olympia introduces a transparent, structured decision process. Over time, the ecosystem
            matures into a culture where proposals, votes, and execution are routine and auditable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Incentive Stability for Miners</h4>
          <p>
            Optional incentive smoothing and a growing ecosystem help maintain robust hashrate and
            long-term PoW security even as block rewards decline over the decade.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>The Foundation for a Public-Goods Economy</h4>
          <p>
            The treasury enables a new class of contributors—researchers, educators, infrastructure
            teams, public-goods builders—to work sustainably on ETC without relying on short-term
            grants or centralized sponsors.

      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-chart-line"></i> A 10-Year Outlook for Ethereum Classic</h3>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, Olympia positions ETC for a future where it is recognized globally as a
        secure, neutral, and sustainable Proof-of-Work smart contract platform.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>A flourishing developer community:</strong>
          Multiple client teams, open-source working groups, and funded research hubs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure-grade reliability:</strong>
          Predictable funding for key services, testnets, explorers, RPCs, and developer tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wider global adoption:</strong>
          Businesses, nation-states, institutions, and grassroots communities can all rely on ETC’s
          neutrality and stability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A robust DAO ecosystem:</strong>
          Child-DAOs for protocol development, security, research, and community engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Long-term PoW viability:</strong>
          A stable incentive environment and a growing ecosystem that supports network security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A living, evolving governance process:</strong>
          Olympia becomes the foundation for future iterations—OIPs, refinements, and next-gen
          governance modules.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>In essence:</strong>
        Olympia transforms ETC from a network dependent on volunteerism and external sponsors into
        a self-sustaining, decentralized, and future-proof smart contract platform grounded in
        immutability and Proof-of-Work.
