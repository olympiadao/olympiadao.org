      <h2>Fukuii: Ethereum Classic’s Native Client for the Olympia Era</h2>
      <p>
        Fukuii is a modern Ethereum Classic client written in Scala and maintained independently of the
        Ethereum Foundation’s Proof-of-Stake roadmap. It continues and rebrands the Mantis client
        lineage, while upgrading the stack to Scala 3, JDK 21, and a contemporary CI/CD and operations
        toolchain. Fukuii is the first client to implement the consensus-layer changes required for the
        Olympia Upgrade, including <strong>ECIP-1111</strong>’s EIP-1559-style BASEFEE mechanics.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        By providing a native, ETC-focused client without upstream Geth dependencies, Fukuii helps
        resolve the client deprecation risks created when Ethereum mainnet moved to Proof-of-Stake and
        optimized for an L2-centric roadmap. For Ethereum Classic, it restores a long-term, sovereign
        path for protocol development and testing—essential for deploying Olympia safely.

      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i> About Fukuii</h3>
      <p>
        Fukuii is a continuation and re-branding of the Ethereum Classic client previously known as
        <strong>Mantis</strong>. Mantis was originally developed by Input Output (HK) as a Scala client
        for Ethereum Classic. Fukuii is an independent fork maintained by <strong>Chippr Robotics LLC</strong>
        with the goal of modernizing the codebase, updating the dependencies, and ensuring long-term
        support for ETC.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project keeps the core architecture and Ethereum Classic compatibility of Mantis, while
        moving to a robust, up-to-date technology stack:

        <strong>Why it matters:</strong> A stable, modern client is a prerequisite for deploying
        protocol upgrades like Olympia in a way that is consistent with Ethereum Classic’s conservative,
        safety-first approach to hard forks.

    <!-- ROLE IN OLYMPIA -->
    <section id="role">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-layer-group"></i> Fukuii’s Role in the Olympia Upgrade</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia introduces a protocol-native funding layer to Ethereum Classic by adding EIP-1559-style
        BASEFEE accounting, redirecting that BASEFEE to an immutable Treasury, and wiring a DAO-based
        governance and funding process on top. Fukuii is the first client to integrate the
        <strong>consensus-layer changes</strong> required to make this possible.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Implementing ECIP-1111</h4>
          <p>
            Fukuii is integrating <strong>ECIP-1111: Olympia EVM &amp; Protocol Upgrades</strong>, which
            introduces EIP-1559-style fee mechanics and the <code>BASEFEE</code> opcode (EIP-3198) to
            Ethereum Classic. On ETC, BASEFEE is not burned; it is redirected at the consensus layer to
            the Olympia Treasury, enabling non-inflationary protocol funding.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Support for type-2 transactions and modern fee market semantics.</li>
            <li>BASEFEE calculation and inclusion in block headers.</li>
            <li>Consensus rules for redirecting BASEFEE to the Treasury address.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Testnet &amp; Bootstrap Improvements</h4>
          <p>
            Fukuii is designed to make testnet experimentation and node operation more practical for
            operators and developers validating Olympia. Recent releases include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Faster initial sync via <strong>bootstrap checkpoints</strong> and trusted pivot blocks.</li>
            <li>Support for ETC mainnet and Mordor testnet out of the box.</li>
            <li>Optional console UI (TUI) for monitoring sync progress.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Client Independence for ETC</h4>
          <p>
            With upstream Geth deprecating Proof-of-Work support and focusing on Ethereum’s PoS and L2
            roadmap, relying solely on forked Geth derivatives increases long-term risk for Ethereum
            Classic. Fukuii provides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>native ETC client</strong> with no dependency on future Ethereum Foundation decisions.</li>
            <li>A codebase and release process aligned with ETC’s upgrade schedule and ECIP process.</li>
            <li>A sustainable platform for testing and deploying Olympia and future ETC upgrades.</li>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>Status Update:</strong>
        As of November 11, 2025 (“Olympia Day”), the Fukuii client is the primary reference
        implementation for ECIP-1111’s consensus-layer changes. Future phases focus on testnet
        deployment, operational testing, and coordination with other clients before any mainnet
        activation is considered through ECIP-1000.

    <!-- RUNNING FUKUII (HIGH-LEVEL) -->
    <section id="run">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-terminal"></i> Running Fukuii</h3>
      <p>
        Fukuii can be run in production or development settings using Docker, GitHub Codespaces, or a
        local build from source. This page provides a high-level overview; operators should always
        consult the official documentation for the latest commands, images, and security practices.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Option 1 – Docker (Recommended for Production)</h4>
          <p>
            The simplest way to run Fukuii in production is via Docker images published to Docker Hub
            and GitHub Container Registry. Images for stable releases are signed and include provenance
            metadata and SBOMs for supply chain verification.

            <li>Integrate liveness and readiness probes with /health and /readiness endpoints.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Refer to the project’s Docker documentation for exact image names, tags, and
            signature-verification steps.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Option 2 – GitHub Codespaces (For Development)</h4>
          <p>
            For developers contributing to Fukuii or testing Olympia changes, GitHub Codespaces provides
            a preconfigured environment with JDK 21, SBT, and Scala tooling pre-installed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Spin up a dev environment directly from the repository.</li>
            <li>Run tests, experiment with configuration, and inspect logs.</li>
            <li>Follow the <code>.devcontainer</code> documentation for usage details.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Option 3 – Local Development</h4>
          <p>
            For operators and developers who prefer running from source, Fukuii can be built locally
            using the standard Scala toolchain.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Requirements include JDK 21, SBT, and Python for auxiliary scripts.</li>
            <li>Build artifacts via <code>sbt dist</code> and run using the <code>fukuii</code> launcher.</li>
            <li>Support for ETC, Mordor, and internal test networks.</li>

    <!-- OPERATIONS & MONITORING -->
    <section id="ops">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse"></i> Operations, Health Checks &amp; Monitoring</h3>
      <p>
        Fukuii is designed for modern infrastructure environments such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm,
        and managed container platforms. It exposes HTTP endpoints for health and readiness checks and
        integrates with metrics and logging systems.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>/health</strong> – basic liveness probe indicating that the node is running.</li>
        <li><strong>/readiness</strong> – readiness probe that checks peer count and chain progress.</li>
        <li><strong>/healthcheck</strong> – detailed node status, including best block numbers and sync state.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These endpoints make it straightforward to wire Fukuii into orchestration tools with restart
        policies, rolling upgrades, and automated alerting. Configuration options allow operators to
        tune thresholds for “stuck” node detection and syncing status.
      </p>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>For Operators:</strong>
        Consult the project’s operations runbooks for recommended dashboards, logging strategies,
        peering configuration, disk management, backup and restore practices, and known issue
        workarounds.
