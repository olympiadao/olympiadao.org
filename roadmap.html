        ECIPs 1111–1115 · From Research to Activation
      </div>

      <h2>A Phased Path for the Olympia Funding Layer</h2>
      <p>
        Olympia is a multi-ECIP upgrade for Ethereum Classic that introduces a protocol-native funding
        layer. Because it touches the fee market, Treasury design, and on-chain governance, it must be
        developed, tested, and adopted conservatively. This roadmap summarizes how the suite—
        <strong>ECIPs 1111 through 1115</strong>—moves from research and drafting to client
        implementations, testnet deployment, community review, and potential mainnet activation.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        As of November 11, 2025 (“Olympia Day”), Ethereum Classic core developers have moved from the
        ECIP drafting phase into reference implementation. The consensus-layer components of
        <strong>ECIP-1111</strong>—EIP-1559-style fee mechanics and the <code>BASEFEE</code> opcode—are
        being integrated into <strong>Fukuii</strong>, a modern Scala-based ETC client derived from the
        former Mantis codebase. Fukuii is maintained independently of the Ethereum Foundation’s
        Proof-of-Stake roadmap, giving Ethereum Classic a native, long-term client path for validating
        Olympia on testnets and, ultimately, considering mainnet activation through the
        <strong>ECIP-1000</strong> process.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- HIGH-LEVEL PHASES -->
    <section id="phases">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-project"></i> High-Level Phases</h3>
      <p>
        The Olympia roadmap can be viewed in five major phases. These phases may overlap in time, but
        each has distinct goals, artifacts, and decision points.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 1 – Research &amp; Problem Definition</h4>
          <p>
            Community calls, historical analysis, and design discussions identify Ethereum Classic’s
            long-standing funding, security, and governance challenges. Existing fee models, treasury
            approaches, and DAO patterns from across the EVM ecosystem are evaluated against ETC’s
            values—immutability, Proof-of-Work, fixed monetary policy, and credible neutrality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 2 – ECIP Drafting &amp; Architecture</h4>
          <p>
            The Olympia concepts are formalized into a modular ECIP suite:
            <strong>ECIP-1111</strong> for fee and EVM upgrades,
            <strong>ECIP-1112</strong> for the immutable Treasury contract,
            <strong>ECIP-1113</strong> for the DAO governance framework,
            <strong>ECIP-1114</strong> for the funding proposal process (ECFP),
            and <strong>ECIP-1115</strong> for optional L-curve smoothing. Each ECIP has a focused
            scope and clearly defined interfaces to the others.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 3 – Reference Implementations &amp; Client Integration</h4>
          <p>
            Core developers build and refine reference implementations for the consensus and contract
            components. As of Olympia Day (November 11, 2025), the consensus-layer changes in
            <strong>ECIP-1111</strong> are being implemented in <strong>Fukuii</strong>, a modern Scala
            client for Ethereum Classic. This phase focuses on correctness, performance, and
            maintainability, while keeping the consensus changes as narrow and conservative as possible.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 4 – Testnet Deployment &amp; Operational Testing</h4>
          <p>
            Once clients and contracts are ready, Olympia components are deployed on testnets such as
            Mordor. The fee market behavior, Treasury flows, governance pipeline, and ECFP lifecycle
            are exercised end-to-end. Miners, node operators, and application developers can observe
            real behavior, stress-test the system, and surface operational issues before any mainnet
            activation is considered.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Phase 5 – Mainnet Activation &amp; Iteration</h4>
          <p>
            If broad consensus emerges, Olympia can be scheduled for a future network upgrade through
            the <strong>ECIP-1000</strong> process. After launch, the Treasury, governance modules,
            and optional smoothing logic can be refined via additional ECIPs and Olympia Improvement
            Proposals (OIPs), guided by live data, security analysis, and community feedback—without
            requiring further disruptive changes to the base protocol.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>Specification-Driven:</strong>
        At every phase, decisions are grounded in the written ECIPs, testnet behavior, and the
        ECIP-1000 process—not in private agreements or off-chain control.
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- KEY MILESTONES & DEPENDENCIES -->
    <section id="milestones">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-timeline"></i> Key Milestones &amp; Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia’s components are modular but interdependent. Some parts can move ahead of others, while
        certain milestones must be completed in sequence. The items below highlight major waypoints and
        how they relate to one another.
      </p>

      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h4>ECIP Suite Drafted (1111–1115)</h4>
          <span>Specifications Available · Subject to Ongoing Review</span>
          <p>
            All five Olympia ECIPs are published as drafts. This provides a full picture of the fee
            market changes, Treasury design, governance framework, funding process, and optional
            smoothing—allowing the community to evaluate the system as a whole even if not all parts
            are activated at once.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h4>Olympia Day – Reference Implementation Begins</h4>
          <span>November 11, 2025 · Fukuii Client Integration</span>
          <p>
            Ethereum Classic core developers transition from ECIP drafting to reference implementation.
            The consensus-layer changes in <strong>ECIP-1111</strong>—including EIP-1559-style fee
            accounting and the <code>BASEFEE</code> opcode—enter active development in the
            <strong>Fukuii</strong> client. This establishes a native, independently maintained ETC
            client path that does not depend on upstream Geth, which has moved to Proof-of-Stake.

        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h4>Fee &amp; BASEFEE Implementation on Testnet (ECIP-1111)</h4>
          <span>Core Prerequisite for Treasury &amp; Smoothing</span>
          <p>
            EIP-1559-style BASEFEE accounting and type-2 transactions are enabled on a testnet.
            Clients are tested for correctness, performance, and compatibility with existing tooling.
            This milestone is required before Treasury flows, governance contracts, and any smoothing
            model can be exercised live.

          <h4>Treasury Contract Deployment &amp; Wiring (ECIP-1112)</h4>
          <span>Vault Ready · BASEFEE Destination Connected</span>
          <p>
            The immutable Olympia Treasury contract is deployed to testnet and configured to receive
            redirected BASEFEE from 1559-style transactions. The integration path from consensus-layer
            BASEFEE to the Treasury address is validated and monitored.

          <span>Governance Loop Exercised End-to-End</span>
          <p>
            Governance contracts, timelocks, and the Executor are deployed alongside the Treasury.
            Ethereum Classic Funding Proposals (ECFPs) are created, voted on, queued, and executed
            against the Treasury on testnet, validating the deterministic, hash-bound pipeline from
            proposal metadata to on-chain payment.

          <p>
            The L-curve smoothing mechanism is modeled and, if desired, trialed on testnets or in
            controlled mainnet configurations. The focus is on understanding how smoothing reshapes
            the timing of payouts to miners and its impact on long-term security budgets, without
            changing total payout amounts or consensus rules.

          <h4>Mainnet Activation Candidate</h4>
          <span>Pending Community Consensus · ECIP-1000 Governance</span>
          <p>
            If testnet behavior is satisfactory and broad community consensus forms, a mainnet
            activation plan can be proposed via the <strong>ECIP-1000</strong> process. This includes
            proposed activation blocks, client readiness, and coordination for miners, node operators,
            and infrastructure providers.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout section-spacer">
        <strong>Dependencies Matter:</strong>
        Fee and BASEFEE changes (ECIP-1111) must be stable before Treasury flows (ECIP-1112) are
        meaningful, and the Treasury must be live before governance and funding proposals (ECIP-1113
        &amp; 1114) can execute. Smoothing (ECIP-1115) sits on top of all of these and remains
        optional throughout.

    <!-- COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION -->
    <section id="participation">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> How the Community Can Participate</h3>
      <p>
        Olympia is designed to emerge from open collaboration between developers, miners, node
        operators, businesses, and community members. There are several ways to engage with the
        roadmap and influence outcomes.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4>Read &amp; Review the ECIPs</h4>
          <p>
            Start with the written specifications. Provide feedback via GitHub comments, issues, or
            public forums. Concrete, line-specific suggestions grounded in ECIP text are especially
            valuable when refining the design.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Test Clients &amp; Contracts</h4>
          <p>
            Run testnet nodes, experiment with the fee market, and interact with the Treasury and
            governance contracts once they are deployed. Operator feedback—from miners, pools, and
            infrastructure providers—is crucial to validating real-world behavior.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Design Governance &amp; Proposal Flows</h4>
          <p>
            ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114 define the framework and data model, but they do not prescribe a
            single voting system or identity scheme. Community members can help design OIPs, ECFP
            templates, and best practices that make the funding process fair, efficient, and resilient.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4>Engage in Public Discussion</h4>
          <p>
            Community calls, forums, and social channels are where tradeoffs are debated and
            priorities are set. Clear, well-reasoned participation—especially from those running
            infrastructure or building on ETC—helps steer the roadmap toward outcomes that align with
            Ethereum Classic’s core principles.
