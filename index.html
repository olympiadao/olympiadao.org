      <h3>Sustainable Sovereignty for Ethereum Classic</h3>
      <p>
        A protocol-native, non-inflationary treasury funded by redirected BASEFEE revenue enables open and decentralized
        support for client maintenance, public goods, and long-term network security — without altering Ethereum
        Classic's monetary policy, miner rewards, or governance rules. Olympia, defined through ECIPs 1111-1115,
        introduces a modern EIP-1559-style transaction type alongside ETC's existing formats. Use of this new
        transaction type is voluntary: all legacy transactions and contracts continue functioning exactly as they do today.
        The full
        BASEFEE component is redirected into an immutable, transparent treasury, creating a sustainable on-chain funding
        layer for the ecosystem while all protocol upgrades continue to follow Ethereum Classic's established
        ECIP governance process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This funding layer addresses long-standing challenges stemming from Ethereum Classic's historical reliance on
        centralized entities, volunteer labor, and sporadic donations. Olympia transitions ETC from these fragile
        dependencies to a self-sustaining, sovereign chain that is no longer reliant on any single organization or
        team. By decentralizing critical development funding, Olympia broadens participation to the global EVM
        developer ecosystem, reducing concentration risks and mitigating the centralizing effects of the prior
        donor-and-sponsor model, where control over core development often followed whoever was willing to pay for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olympia strengthens Ethereum Classic's commitment to credible neutrality by ensuring the network remains
        resilient against corporate capture, stagnation, and operational decay — enabling ETC to grow as a truly
        decentralized, self-funded Proof-of-Work blockchain.

      <h3>Olympia Overview</h3>
    
      <h4 class="subheader">Why ETC Needed a Funding Layer</h4>
      <p>
        For most of its history, Ethereum Classic relied on external sponsors, donor-driven initiatives, and volunteer
        labor to support core development and infrastructure — a fragile and inconsistent funding model for a global
        blockchain. The Olympia Upgrade introduces a <strong>protocol-native, transparent, non-inflationary</strong>
        funding layer by adding <strong>BASEFEE</strong> via ECIP-1111 and redirecting that revenue into the immutable
        Treasury defined in ECIP-1112.
      </p>
    
      <h4 class="subheader">Why ETC Is Uniquely Positioned</h4>
      <p>
        As the <strong>only major Proof-of-Work blockchain with native smart contracts</strong>, Ethereum Classic is
        uniquely positioned to deploy a sustainable, on-chain treasury and governance model. While other PoW networks
        depend on centralized committees, informal volunteerism, or off-chain grants, ETC can leverage the full
        expressiveness of the EVM — including DAO governance, transparent proposal workflows, cryptographic metadata
        binding, and battle-tested public-goods funding mechanisms pioneered across the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
      </p>
    
      <h4 class="subheader">How Olympia Works at a High Level</h4>
      <p>
        Olympia brings these capabilities to a PoW environment in a way no other chain can: a decentralized,
        programmable, and auditable funding system for core protocol work. Its architecture draws on <strong>best
          practices in open governance, audited smart contracts, and empirical evidence</strong> accumulated over nearly a
        decade of EVM-based DAO evolution — while preserving ETC's fixed monetary policy, Proof-of-Work consensus, and
        ECIP upgrade process. Olympia introduces no inflation, no new token, and retains a governance model that is
        open, sybil-resistant, and accountable to the ecosystem.
      </p>
    
      <h4 class="subheader">What Olympia Makes Possible</h4>
      <p>
        Instead of altering ETC's monetary policy or block rewards, Olympia redirects value that would be burned on
        other EVM chains into a shared on-chain public-goods treasury governed through a modular DAO framework and a
        standardized funding proposal process. Olympia advances the community's original 2016 commitment — expressed in
        the <a href="https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-08-13-declaration-of-independence" target="_blank">
          Ethereum Classic Declaration of Independence</a> — that the chain remain sovereign, censorship-resistant, and
        free from third-party control. With EVM compatibility enabling modern governance tooling and DAO workflows,
        Ethereum Classic can now <strong>stand on its own — transparently funded, independent by design, and resilient
          against corporate capture or governance shortcuts</strong>.

            improving EVM compatibility and fee predictability. On Ethereum Classic, the <code>BASEFEE</code>

            Defines an optional governance-layer mechanism for smoothing Treasury-held BASEFEE over time using a

        Together, these ECIPs form the Olympia framework — a modular, upgrade-friendly funding layer that gives
        Ethereum Classic a reliable, transparent, and decentralized mechanism to sustain clients and public goods.
        Only minimal consensus changes are required (ECIP-1111), while all governance, proposal processing, and
        allocation logic operate in the contract layer where they can evolve safely over time. This architecture
        preserves Ethereum Classic's foundational guarantees — <strong>immutability, permissionlessness, censorship
          resistance, Proof-of-Work security, and decentralized governance</strong> — while enabling long-term,
        sustainable ecosystem development.

    <!-- ABOUT ETC & OLYMPIA -->
    <section id="about">
      <h3>About Ethereum Classic &amp; the Olympia Upgrade</h3>

      <p>
        Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum chain, rooted in the <strong>Code is Law</strong> philosophy,
        Proof-of-Work security, and a long-standing commitment to immutability, neutrality, and open participation.
        Throughout its history, ETC has chosen to preserve chain integrity and resist governance shortcuts — even when
        that meant fewer resources or slower development — in order to uphold its foundational principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olympia builds on these principles rather than altering them. It introduces a transparent, on-chain funding
        layer for client maintenance, public goods, and ecosystem growth, all while preserving ETC’s fixed monetary
        policy, Proof-of-Work consensus, and the ECIP upgrade process. Olympia does not rewrite history, add
        inflation, or shift protocol governance into a token-voting model. Instead, it provides the sustainable,
        decentralized funding infrastructure needed for Ethereum Classic to remain a secure, credible, and independent
        Proof-of-Work smart contract platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site presents a high-level overview of the Olympia framework. The full, canonical specifications are
        published in the official Ethereum Classic <a href="https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org" target="_blank">ECIP</a>
        repository and serve as the authoritative reference for
