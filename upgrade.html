      <h3>Olympia: The Funding Layer for Ethereum Classic</h3>

      <p>
        Olympia is the upgrade that gives Ethereum Classic a sustainable, protocol-native funding layer.
        It unifies modern fee mechanics, an immutable Treasury, and on-chain governance into a coherent,
        transparent system. Defined across <strong>ECIPs 1111 through 1115</strong>, Olympia introduces
        these capabilities without changing ETC's fixed monetary policy, miner incentives, or Proof-of-Work
        consensus.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Olympia establishes how BASEFEE accounting, a non-inflationary Treasury, and a deterministic governance
        and funding process work together at the protocol and contract layers. It is designed to support the full
        spectrum of participants who rely on Ethereum Classic—including miners and mining pools, developers,
        node operators, institutional custodians, exchanges, wallets, digital asset funds, traditional financial
        products such as ETFs, governments exploring blockchain infrastructure, and everyday end users—by providing
        a transparent, accountable way to sustain core infrastructure without relying on centralized donors or
        off-chain sponsors.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On November 11, 2025 (“Olympia Day”), the Olympia ECIP suite moved from research and drafting into active
        implementation. ECIP-1111 is now being integrated into multiple Ethereum Classic clients, including
        <strong>Fukuii</strong>, a modern Scala-based native ETC implementation, and <strong>Core-Geth</strong>,
        the network's long-standing Go client now in maintenance mode. This transition marks the beginning of the
        multi-client validation required under <strong>ECIP-1000</strong> and highlights the need for long-term,
        and highlights the need for long-term, sustainable funding for Ethereum Classic's core infrastructure — one of Olympia's defining goals.

        improving EVM compatibility and fee predictability. On Ethereum Classic, the <code>BASEFEE</code>
        is <strong>not burned</strong>; instead, 100% is redirected at the consensus layer to the Olympia

    Together, these ECIPs form the Olympia framework — a modular, upgrade-friendly funding layer that gives
    Ethereum Classic a reliable, transparent, and decentralized mechanism to sustain clients and public goods.
    Only minimal consensus changes are required (ECIP-1111), while all governance, proposal processing, and
    allocation logic operate in the contract layer where they can evolve safely over time. This architecture
    preserves Ethereum Classic's foundational guarantees — <strong>immutability, permissionlessness, censorship
    resistance, Proof-of-Work security, and decentralized governance</strong> — while enabling a flexible,
    extensible treasury system built for long-term sustainability.

<!-- FLOW -->
<section id="flow">
  <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-turn-to-dots"></i> How the Funding Loop Actually Works</h3>
  <p>
    After Olympia, every 1559-style transaction on Ethereum Classic participates in a simple loop:
    fees are charged, BASEFEE is redirected, funds accumulate in the Treasury, and governance decides
    how and when those funds return to the ecosystem. The ECIP suite breaks this loop into clear,
    well-defined stages.
  </p>

  <div class="flow-steps">
    <div class="flow-step">
      <h4>1. Transactions &amp; BASEFEE <span class="subtext">(ECIP-1111)</span></h4>
      <p>
        Users submit EIP-1559-style transactions. The protocol calculates a <code>BASEFEE</code> for each block
        and charges it per unit of gas used. On ETC, this BASEFEE is never burned.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flow-step">
      <h4>2. BASEFEE Flows into the Treasury <span class="subtext">(ECIP-1111 &amp; 1112)</span></h4>
      <p>
        Instead of being destroyed, 100% of the BASEFEE is redirected at the consensus layer to the immutable
        Olympia Treasury contract, where it accumulates as protocol revenue.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flow-step">
      <h4>3. Governance Controls Access <span class="subtext">(ECIP-1113)</span></h4>
      <p>
        Only the Governor → Timelock → Executor pipeline defined in ECIP-1113 can instruct the Treasury to
        release funds. There are no admin keys or backdoors; all movement is driven by on-chain governance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flow-step">
      <h4>4. Funding Proposals Drive Spending <span class="subtext">(ECIP-1114)</span></h4>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic Funding Proposals (ECFPs) describe who gets paid, for what work, and under which
        conditions. Each proposal is hash-bound to its off-chain metadata and executed through a deterministic
        tuple, ensuring that what was approved is exactly what the Treasury executes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flow-step">
      <h4>5. Optional Smoothing of Payouts <span class="subtext">(ECIP-1115)</span></h4>
      <p>
        If activated, ECIP-1115 applies a deterministic L-curve to shape <em>when</em> miner payouts are
        released from the Treasury—without changing the total amount approved by governance or altering
        consensus rules.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="section-spacer">
    Together, these stages turn BASEFEE into a <strong>transparent, programmable public-goods engine</strong>:
    users pay for block space, protocol revenue accumulates in an immutable Treasury, and a modular governance
    process decides how that value is returned to clients, infrastructure, and ecosystem growth—without
    changing Ethereum Classic's fixed monetary policy or Proof-of-Work consensus.

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-server"></i> The Ethereum Classic Client Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          Ethereum Classic's execution-layer clients form the backbone of the network, yet for most of its
          history the ecosystem has lacked a sustainable, long-term way to fund their development. ECIP-1000
          expects upgrades like Olympia to be validated across multiple independent implementations, but
          maintaining those clients has relied on short-term grants, volunteer labor, or upstream forks—
          none of which provide durable support for the critical software that secures the chain. As Olympia
          enters the implementation and testing phase, the current client landscape highlights both ETC's
          strengths and the long-standing maintenance challenges that Olympia is explicitly designed to solve.

            <p>
              Fukuii is a modern, independently maintained Scala-based Ethereum Classic client derived from the
              former Mantis codebase. Actively developed and fully supported, Fukuii is the first implementation to
              integrate <strong>ECIP-1111</strong> and serves as the primary engineering roadmap for Olympia's
              consensus-layer changes. Its updated architecture, robust tooling, and frequent releases restore a
              native ETC client path that is not dependent on the Ethereum Foundation's upstream design decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fukuii provides the modern baseline required for reliable testnet validation and future mainnet

            </h4>
            <p>
              Core-Geth has served as Ethereum Classic's primary execution client for several years and remains the
              most widely deployed node software on the network. However, Core-Geth is now in a maintenance-only
              state, with its last major release on <strong>June 10, 2024</strong> and its last repository update on
              <strong>January 23, 2025</strong>. Although still operational, the client carries known issues such as
              sync instability, SNAP-sync failures, peer discovery inconsistencies, and aging network configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              This limited maintenance highlights Ethereum Classic's critical need for sustainable funding and
              multiple actively developed clients — a core motivation for the Olympia Upgrade.

              Hyperledger Besu remains capable of connecting to and syncing with Ethereum Classic, but its ETC-specific
              functionality is effectively deprecated following Ethereum's transition to Proof-of-Stake. Upstream Besu
              development is increasingly PoS-oriented, and its PoW execution logic will continue to age without
              dedicated ETC-focused contributors.

            <p>
              Besu remains useful for experimentation, tooling compatibility, or specialized development workflows, but
              it is not positioned today as a primary ETC client and would require significant engineering investment

        <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-route"></i> The Path from Ideation to Mainnet (ECIP-1000)</h3>

        <p>
          All protocol upgrades on Ethereum Classic follow <strong>ECIP-1000</strong>, a transparent, decentralized
          framework that outlines how proposals move from early drafts to mainnet activation. ECIP-1000 ensures that
          upgrades like Olympia advance through a <strong>specification-driven, implementation-backed,
            consensus-oriented</strong>
          process—not personality, politics, or foundation control.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Open Ideation:</strong> Anyone may propose an ECIP. Discussion, critique, and refinement are open
            to all participants with no permission or gatekeeping.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Minimum Requirements:</strong> Draft ECIPs must be clearly written, technically sound, aligned
            with ETC's philosophy, represent a net improvement, and avoid unnecessary complexity.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Editor Responsibilities:</strong> Editors assign ECIP numbers and ensure standards compliance.
            They may <em>not</em> unreasonably reject an ECIP and cannot block upgrades based on preference.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Public Review:</strong> Comments are never censored; anyone may review or critique ECIPs.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Implementation &amp; Testnets:</strong> Only ECIPs with working client implementations and
            successful testnet validation progress toward activation.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Mainnet Activation:</strong> Requires broad technical and social consensus among miners, client
            developers, node operators, and ecosystem participants. No single actor has veto power.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This process guarantees that Olympia's progress is determined by <strong>work produced</strong>,
          <strong>clients implemented</strong>, and <strong>testnets validated</strong>—not by centralized influence.

          <strong>Specification-Driven Review:</strong>
          ECIP-1000 encourages open participation from anyone, but also emphasizes that reviewers should engage
          within their area of knowledge and ground feedback in the written ECIP text. This helps keep discussions
          focused, technically accurate, and constructive. Comments are never censored and participation is open to
          the public, but effective review relies on clear reasoning, specific references to the specification, and

          through personal preference, procedural hurdles, or requirements not found in the specification. Editors
          are responsible for enforcing formatting and minimum criteria, not inventing new standards. Olympia's
          progress depends on clear specifications, working implementations, and successful testnet behavior—not
          subjective objections or off-chain influence. As long as those objective criteria are satisfied, Olympia
          continues moving forward through Ethereum Classic's established governance process toward potential
          activation.
