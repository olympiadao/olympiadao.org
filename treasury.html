      </div>
      <h2>A Non-Inflationary, Immutable Vault for Protocol Revenue</h2>
      <p>
        ECIP-1112 defines the <strong>Olympia Treasury</strong>: a protocol-controlled, immutable smart
        contract that receives BASEFEE redirected by ECIP-1111 and disburses funds only through
        standardized governance calls defined in ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114.
      </p>
      <p class="sub">
        The treasury does not mint new ETC, has no privileged upgrade keys, and is intentionally
        minimalist. Its purpose is to securely hold protocol revenue and execute payments
        authorized by the Olympia DAO.

      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-landmark"></i> Role of the Olympia Treasury</h3>
      <p>
        The Olympia Treasury is the <strong>on-chain vault</strong> at the center of the upgrade.
        It is the endpoint for redirected BASEFEE and the source of funds for approved public-goods
        proposals.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Olympia architecture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ECIP-1111</strong> handles BASEFEE accounting and redirection.</li>
        <li><strong>ECIP-1112</strong> defines the treasury vault that receives those funds.</li>
        <li><strong>ECIP-1113</strong> defines the DAO framework that can authorize withdrawals.</li>
        <li><strong>ECIP-1114</strong> defines the proposal and execution process.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can think of the treasury as:
      </p>
      <div class="pill-row">
        <span class="pill">Single source of truth for protocol funds</span>
        <span class="pill">Minimal, auditable state machine</span>
        <span class="pill">No governance baked into the vault</span>
        <span class="pill">Governed externally by Olympia DAO</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        By limiting the treasury’s responsibilities to <strong>holding and releasing funds</strong>,
        ECIP-1112 keeps the contract simple to reason about and easy to monitor, while letting
        governance logic evolve in separate, upgradeable modules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="design">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-cubes-stacked"></i> Design &amp; Core Invariants</h3>
      <p>
        ECIP-1112 is built around a small set of strict invariants. These invariants are what give
        the treasury its security properties and make it acceptable as a protocol-level funding
        mechanism.
      </p>

      <div class="cards">
        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>Invariant 1</span> No Minting, No Inflation</h4>
          <p>
            The treasury <strong>cannot mint ETC</strong>. It can only hold what it receives
            (for example, redirected BASEFEE) and send those funds to other addresses. The ETC
            supply remains governed entirely by the existing block reward schedule.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No functions that increase total ETC supply.</li>
            <li>All balances can be derived from inflows and outflows on-chain.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>Invariant 2</span> Immutable Contract Code</h4>
          <p>
            Once deployed, the treasury contract code is <strong>immutable</strong>. There are no
            upgrade keys, no proxy indirection, and no owner address that can change its behavior.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>No upgradeable proxy patterns.</li>
            <li>No admin-only methods to alter core logic.</li>
            <li>Long-term predictability for all users and stakeholders.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>Invariant 3</span> Protocol-Controlled, Not Multisig-Controlled</h4>
          <p>
            The treasury is <strong>owned by the protocol</strong>, not by a multisig or a legal
            entity. It is wired directly into consensus rules that define:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How BASEFEE is redirected into the contract (via ECIP-1111).</li>
            <li>Which governance modules can trigger authorized withdrawals.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is no “emergency key” that can bypass or override the DAO.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>Invariant 4</span> Minimal External Interface</h4>
          <p>
            The treasury exposes a <strong>minimal set of functions</strong>, primarily:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Accepting protocol-directed inflows (e.g., BASEFEE).</li>
            <li>Executing payments to recipients when instructed by authorized governance modules.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It does not implement proposal logic, voting, or complex business rules. Those live
            in the DAO contracts defined by ECIP-1113 and ECIP-1114.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h4><span>Invariant 5</span> Transparent State &amp; Auditable History</h4>
          <p>
            All treasury-related data is fully on-chain and accessible:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full transaction history is visible via block explorers.</li>
            <li>Simple read-only methods expose balances &amp; payment history.</li>
            <li>Supports analytics and monitoring without special access.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong>
        ECIP-1112 treats the treasury as a <em>pure vault</em>. All politics, preferences, and
        participation rules live in the governance layer (ECIP-1113/1114), not in the contract
        that holds funds.

    <section id="flows">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-right-arrow-left"></i> Funding Flows: From Fees to Public Goods</h3>
      <p>
        The Olympia Treasury exists as part of a wider pipeline that connects transaction fees
        to public-goods funding. At a high level, the flow looks like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Fees Paid:</strong> Users submit transactions using EIP-1559-style fields (ECIP-1111),
          paying BASEFEE + tip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Revenue Split:</strong> Miners receive block rewards and tips, while BASEFEE is redirected
          to a destination chosen by consensus—typically the Olympia Treasury.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Treasury Accumulates Funds:</strong> The treasury contract accumulates BASEFEE over time.
          Its balance and history are visible to everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proposals Submitted:</strong> Projects and contributors submit funding proposals using the
          process defined in ECIP-1114.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>DAO Approval:</strong> The Olympia DAO (ECIP-1113) reviews, votes on, and authorizes
          eligible proposals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payments Executed:</strong> Once a proposal is approved and conditions are met, the treasury
          executes payments to recipients as defined by the governance contracts.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This structure ensures a <strong>clear line of sight</strong> from fees paid by users to
        public goods funded on Ethereum Classic.

    <section id="security">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-shield-halved"></i> Security Model &amp; Operational Considerations</h3>
      <p>
        Because the treasury is protocol-controlled and immutable, its security model is tied to
        the security of Ethereum Classic itself:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client implementations must correctly enforce the rules defined in ECIP-1112.</li>
        <li>Consensus rules ensure that only authorized governance calls can move funds.</li>
        <li>Any change to the treasury’s behavior requires a new ECIP and network upgrade.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From an operational perspective:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Node operators do not need to manage private keys for the treasury; it is controlled by
          protocol rules, not by a wallet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explorers and analytics tools can track inflows and outflows to support transparency
          and community oversight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Governance participants focus on proposal quality and execution conditions rather than
          low-level custody mechanics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong>
        The treasury reduces reliance on trusted custodians and multisigs. Security depends on
        <em>protocol correctness</em> and <em>open governance</em>, not on the operational hygiene
        of a small group of signers.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="faq">
      <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> FAQ – Treasury Design</h3>

      <p><strong>Does the treasury introduce inflation?</strong></p>
      <p>
        No. The treasury cannot mint ETC. It only receives existing protocol revenue (such as BASEFEE)
        and releases those funds according to governance decisions. The ETC monetary policy remains
        fixed by the block reward schedule.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Can the treasury contract be upgraded later?</strong></p>
      <p>
        No. ECIP-1112 specifies that the contract is immutable. Future changes must be implemented
        through new ECIPs and new contracts, not by upgrading the original treasury in place.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Who controls the treasury?</strong></p>
      <p>
        The treasury is controlled by protocol rules and the governance layer, not by a foundation
        or multisig. It responds only to authorized calls from contracts specified by ECIP-1113
        and ECIP-1114.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Can funds be moved without a governance proposal?</strong></p>
      <p>
        No. The treasury’s withdrawal functions are restricted to authorized governance modules.
        There is no “back door” for arbitrary transfers.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What happens if the DAO design changes in the future?</strong></p>
      <p>
        The treasury is intentionally DAO-agnostic. New governance modules or processes can be
        added via future ECIPs and connected to the treasury, as long as the network agrees and
        updates its rules accordingly.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Where can I see how treasury funds are being used?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Because the treasury is a smart contract, all inflows and outflows are public. Explorers
        and dashboards can show:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Current treasury balance.</li>
        <li>Historical inflows from BASEFEE.</li>
        <li>Payments linked to approved proposals.</li>
      </ul>
